Classification of measures to protect the population from man-made <br />radiation as a result of accidents at nuclear power plants</em></strong></p><p>The classification of measures to protect the population from radiation was developed in accordance with the Resolution of the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Belarus dated 28.12.2012 “On approval of Sanitary norms and rules “Radiation safety requirements”.</p><p><strong>Urgent protective measure </strong>– a protective measure in the event of an emergency that, in order to be effective, must be carried out promptly (usually within a few hours) and the effectiveness of which will be significantly reduced if it is delayed.</p><p><strong>Urgent protective measures include: </strong>evacuation, decontamination of people, sheltering, respiratory protection, thyroid blocking, and restrictions on the consumption of potentially contaminated foods.</p><p><strong>Long-term measures include: </strong>resettlement, agricultural countermeasures, and restoration measures.</p><p><strong>Evacuation and resettlement. </strong>In April-May 1986, measures to protect the population and eliminate the consequences of the Chernobyl accident were carried out under the leadership of the Council of Ministers of the USSR and the Ministry of Health of the USSR. The most important measures to protect the population were evacuation and resettlement.</p><p><strong>Evacuation </strong>is an urgent, temporary movement (removal) of people from a territory in order to prevent or reduce short-term radiation exposure in the event of an emergency.</p><p><strong>Resettlement (resettlement) </strong>is a non-emergency removal or mass movement of people from a contaminated territory (zone) in order to prevent chronic exposure.</p><p>A distinction is made between <strong><em>permanent resettlement </em></strong>(the duration exceeds one or two years and return is not envisaged) and <strong><em>temporary resettlement</em></strong>.</p><p>Following the disaster at Unit 4 of the Chernobyl NPP, the evacuation of the population of Belarus was carried out taking into account the assessment of the exposure dose of radiation. Initially, the evacuation was carried out within a 10-km radius of the Chernobyl NPP. In this territory, the radiation dose reached 25 mR /h. Subsequently, evacuation was carried out in a 30-km zone from the Chernobyl NPP. The exposure dose of radiation in this zone was 5 mR /h. The 30-km zone of the Chernobyl disaster covered 3 districts of the Republic of Belarus - Bragin, Khoiniki, Narovlya. Evacuation in these territories began on May 2, 1986. Within three days, 50 villages with a population of 11,035 people were evacuated. From June 2 to 9, an additional resettlement of 28 villages (6,017 people) was carried out. Another 29 villages (7,327 people) were additionally resettled at the end of August.</p><p>During 1986, 24.7 thousand residents were evacuated and resettled from 107 of the most contaminated settlements in Belarus.</p><p>Subsequently, measures were taken to resettle people from the priority and subsequent resettlement zones. These measures were completed in 2007. <strong>Over a period of more than 20 years, 137.7 thousand people were evacuated and resettled from the most contaminated settlements of the Republic of Belarus. </strong>In addition, 200 thousand people left the radioactively contaminated territories on their own.</p><p><strong>Decontamination of people. </strong>The most important measure for decontamination of people is <strong>sanitary treatment</strong>. The main methods of this measure are: the use of insulating films and biological protection.</p><p><strong>Insulating films </strong>are designed to prevent contamination of the skin of exposed areas of the body and to remove radionuclides from the skin surface. Various pastes, ointments, and special creams are used as insulating films. If various plutonium compounds come into contact with the skin, 96% clay pastes with various additives can be used Kaolin (white clay) is used to protect against other radioactive substances. Laundry soap and soda ash are used as additives to this product. Despite the protective properties of insulating films, they do not exclude the irradiation of people with beta particles and gamma quanta. Bioprotection is used to reduce this irradiation.</p><p><strong>There are two types of biological protection </strong>- individual and group. <strong>Individual protection </strong>is characterized by the use of clothing with lead plates (half helmets, aprons, swimming trunks, shoe covers, etc.). <strong>Group biological protection </strong>is represented by technical systems consisting of shielded equipment cabins. It has been established that insulating films do not guarantee complete protection of the skin from exposure to radioactive substances.</p><p>In addition to the use of insulating films and bioprotection, there are other methods of sanitizing people. The simplest method of decontaminating the skin is to use warm water with soap. If the sebaceous glands secrete fat intensively, the skin can be treated with alcohol or ether. If the nose and ears are contaminated with radioactive dust, they are washed with water.</p><p><strong>Thyroid blocking. </strong>The main method of protecting the thyroid gland from radioactive iodine-131 is <strong>iodine prophylaxis</strong>. This method is characterized by saturating the thyroid gland with drugs containing stable iodine (Table 9).</p><p>Table 9</p><p><strong>Use of potassium iodide in radiation injuries</strong></p><table><tr><td><p><strong>Age group</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Dose</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Frequency and duration of use</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Adults and children from 14 years old</p></td><td><p>tablet 0.125 g</p></td><td><p>Every day for <br />7 days</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Children from 3 to 14 years old</p></td><td><p>tablet 0.065 g</p></td><td><p>Every day for <br />7 days</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Children under 3 years old</p></td><td><p>tablet 0.065 g</p></td><td><p>Every day for <br />2 days</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Pregnant and breastfeeding women</p></td><td><p>tablet 0.125 g</p></td><td><p>Every day for <br />2 days</p></td></tr></table><p>Iodine-containing drugs include: potassium iodide, 5% solution of iodine tincture (Table 10).</p><p>Table 10</p><p><strong>Use of 5% iodine tincture in accidents at nuclear power plants</strong></p><table><tr><td><p><strong>Directions for <br />use</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Age group</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Dose</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Frequency <br />and duration of use</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3"><p>Internal</p></td><td><p>Adults and children from 14 years old</p></td><td><p>44 drops or 22 drops</p></td><td><p>1 time per day for 7 days</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Children from 5 to 14 years old</p></td><td><p>22 drops</p></td><td><p>1 time per day for 7 days</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Children under 5 years old</p></td><td colspan="2"><p>Not assigned</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3"><p>External</p></td><td><p>Adults and children from 14 years old</p></td><td><p>44 drops each</p></td><td><p>1 time per day for 7 days</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Children from 2 to 14 years old</p></td><td><p>22 drops</p></td><td><p>1 time per day for 7 days</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Children under 2 years old</p></td><td><p>11 drops</p></td><td><p>1 time per day for 7 days</p></td></tr></table><p>For external use, iodine tincture is poured into the palm of the hand and then applied to the forearm or shin.</p><p>Usually, a 5% solution of iodine tincture is used in the absence of potassium iodide tablets.</p><p><strong>Respiratory protection. </strong>To protect the respiratory system from radioactive contamination, it is necessary to use various personal protective equipment: gas masks, respirators, cotton-gauze bandages, anti-dust fabric masks.</p><p><strong>Shelter. </strong>One of the most important ways to protect the population from the effects of ionizing radiation is temporary shelter in houses and shelters. The protective properties of various objects are determined by the radiation dose attenuation coefficient (Table 11).</p><p>Table 11</p><p><strong>Radiation attenuation coefficient of various objects</strong></p><table><tr><td><p><strong>Object</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Attenuation coefficient</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Wooden houses</p><p>Basements</p></td><td><p>2–13</p><p>7–16</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Brick houses</p><p>Basements</p></td><td><p>10–75</p><p>37–600</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Fallout shelters</p></td><td><p>100–500</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Shelters</p></td><td><p>1350–9100</p></td></tr></table><p>In addition to the protective properties of the object, sealing the premises (tightly closing doors, windows, chimneys and ventilation openings) helps reduce radiation.</p><p><strong>Countermeasures in agriculture. </strong>After the Chernobyl disaster, lands in the intensive agricultural zone in Belarus were contaminated. As of January 2022, due to natural decay, the area of land contaminated with radionuclides has decreased, and agriculture is carried out on an area of 836.6 thousand hectares of land with a cesium-137 contamination density of more than 37 kBq / m<sup>2 </sup>(more than 1 Ci / km<sup>2</sup>), of which 281.5 thousand hectares are simultaneously contaminated with strontium-90 more than 5.55 kBq /m<sup>2 </sup>(more than 0.15 Ci / km<sup>2 </sup>). This area includes 59 districts of the Republic of Belarus (Table 12).</p><p>Table 12</p><p><strong>Distribution of agricultural land contaminated with cesium-137 <br />by regions of Belarus in 2022</strong></p><table><tr><td><p><strong>Region</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Pollution of agricultural lands, %</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Gomel</p></td><td><p>59.9</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Mogilevskaya</p></td><td><p>29.8</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Brest</p></td><td><p>4.3</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Minsk</p></td><td><p>4.4</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Grodno</p></td><td><p>1.6</p></td></tr></table><p>Contamination of soils with strontium-90 was recorded simultaneously with cesium-137 on an area of 348.2 thousand hectares. The entry of strontium-90 from soil into plants is 10 times higher than that of cesium-137 with the same contamination density. The peculiarities of entry of strontium-90 into plants are due to its high mobility.</p><p>Unlike strontium-90, cesium-137 is more rapidly transferred from feed to meat and dairy products.</p><p>In 50–70% of cases, the human radiation dose occurs due to the intake of radioactive substances into the body with food.</p><p><strong>There are two stages in the implementation of protective measures in agriculture:</strong></p><p>Stage 1 – 1986–1992.</p><p>Stage 2 – from 1992 to the present.</p><p><strong>At the initial stage, </strong>measures were taken to remove agricultural lands with high levels of radioactive contamination from use. Legumes such as peas, clover, lupine, and alfalfa were excluded from crop rotation. These crops are characterized by high levels of strontium-90. In addition, phosphorus-potassium fertilizers were applied in high doses to contaminated areas, and liming of acidic soils was carried out.</p><p><strong>The second stage </strong>is characterized by the continuation of various agrochemical and agrotechnical measures. At this stage, the following were developed:</p><ul><li>Republican permissible levels of cesium and strontium in food products and drinking water (RDU-99);</li><li>Republican permissible levels of cesium-137 and strontium-90 in agricultural raw materials and feed;</li><li>recommendations for conducting agricultural production in conditions of radioactive contamination of lands in the Republic of Belarus;</li><li>a number of recommendations for obtaining plant products with low levels of radionuclides.</li></ul><p><strong>Recovery measures. </strong>Activities carried out to restore the affected regions of Belarus include:</p><p>1. Construction of various facilities (housing and public utilities, education, healthcare).</p><p>2. Gasification.</p><p>3. Providing contaminated areas with clean drinking water.</p><p><strong>Recommendations for limiting the consumption of potentially radionuclide-contaminated food products. </strong>When consuming radioactively contaminated food products, it is necessary to take into account their ability to accumulate radioactive substances. The most important factors determining the concentration of radionuclides in plants are the biological characteristics of the root system. Plants with a shallow root system are characterized by the greatest accumulation of radionuclides. It has been established that about 95% of all radioactive substances contained in the soil are in its 5-centimeter layer. Migration of radioactive substances into the underlying soil layers is very slow.</p><p>Concentrating in plants, radionuclides subsequently enter the body of animals and humans. In order to reduce the intake of radioactive substances into the body, it is necessary to pay attention to the following food products: vegetables, fruits, berries, mushrooms, meat, fish.</p><p><strong><em>Vegetable crops. </em></strong>Vegetables are characterized by the accumulation of cesium-137. According to the degree of reduction of <sup>137 </sup>Cs content, vegetable crops can be distributed in the following sequence: sweet pepper, cabbage, potatoes, beets, sorrel, radishes, onions, garlic, carrots, cucumbers, tomatoes.</p><p><strong>Berries. </strong>Berries that accumulate radionuclides more intensively include: blueberries, lingonberries, black currants, cranberries. Berries that accumulate radionuclides less intensively include strawberries, gooseberries, raspberries, and rowanberries.</p><p><strong>Mushrooms. </strong>According to the accumulation of radionuclides, there are 4 groups of mushrooms:</p><p><strong><em>1) Accumulator mushrooms: </em></strong>Polish mushroom, yellow-brown boletus, saffron milk cap, autumn butter mushroom.</p><p><strong><em>2) Mushrooms that heavily accumulate radionuclides: </em></strong>milk mushroom, black milk mushroom, yellow chanterelle, birch bolete.</p><p><strong><em>3) Mushrooms that accumulate radionuclides moderately: </em></strong>boletus, aspen mushroom, common russula, autumn honey mushroom.</p><p><strong><em>4) Mushrooms with the lowest accumulation of radionuclides (discriminators): </em></strong>champignon, winter honey fungus, common morel, whole and brown russula.</p><p>The most important factor in the accumulation of radionuclides in mushrooms is the density of soil contamination with radionuclides in the places of harvesting. Therefore, with a soil contamination density of more than 15 Ci/km2, <sup>even </sup>in discriminator mushrooms, the content of radionuclides exceeding permissible levels is noted.</p><p><strong>Fruits. </strong>This type of plant product is characterized by a slight accumulation of radioactive substances. There are cases of surface contamination of the fruit when harvesting fruits (especially damaged ones) on contaminated soil. Reducing the surface contamination of fruits is facilitated by reducing their contact with the soil and thoroughly cleaning them from soil before storing.</p><p><strong>Meat. </strong>When assessing the content of radioactive substances in livestock products, the following factors are taken into account: type of product, age of animals, chemical composition of radionuclides and their distribution in tissues and organs. High levels of radioactive substances are typical for poultry, beef and lamb. Cesium is concentrated in significant quantities in the meat of old animals. Accumulation of strontium is noted in the bones of young animals. The highest content of radionuclides in the body of animals is found in the lungs, kidneys and liver.</p><p>Radionuclides also accumulate in significant quantities in the meat of wild animals. The largest amount of radionuclides is concentrated in wild boar and hare.</p><p><strong>Fish. </strong>The main contribution to radioactive contamination of fish is made by cesium-137. Contamination with this radionuclide depends on the habitat of the fish. Fish living in rivers concentrate an insignificant amount of radionuclides. This is explained by the fact that the efficiency of the dilution process of radionuclides in rivers is very high. The most contaminated are predatory and bottom fish: pike, perch, carp, crucian carp, catfish. </p><p><strong><em>10.3. Food Radiation Monitoring and Control System</em></strong></p><p><strong>Radiation monitoring </strong>is a system of regular observations for the purpose of analyzing and forecasting the radiation situation. Radiation monitoring is part of the National Environmental Monitoring System of the Republic of Belarus.</p><p>The objects of radiation monitoring are atmospheric air, underground and surface waters, and soil. Monitoring of the radiation situation in Belarus is carried out according to the territorial-production principle. Monitoring units are created by various departmental structures.</p><p><strong>Tasks of departmental structures. <em>The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection </em></strong>conducts an assessment of the radiation situation in the territories of populated areas exposed to radiation after the Chernobyl disaster.</p><p><strong><em>The Ministry of Agriculture and Food exercises control over:</em></strong></p><ul><li>radioactive contamination of agricultural lands owned by farms and gardening associations;</li><li>radioactive contamination of water used by processing plants from their own wells and water used for animal watering;</li><li>the content of radionuclides in agricultural raw materials and products produced in agricultural organizations and purchased from farms.</li></ul><p>At markets, analysis of the content of radioactive substances is carried out by veterinary and sanitary laboratories.</p><p><strong><em>The Ministry of Forestry </em></strong>is monitoring radioactive contamination of forest resources and forest products in areas affected by Chernobyl radionuclide fallout.</p><p><strong><em>The Ministry of Housing and Public Utilities </em></strong>is conducting an analysis:</p><ul><li>radionuclide content in drinking water;</li><li>the content of radionuclides in wastewater and its sediments at sewage treatment plants;</li><li>radioactive contamination of municipal waste.</li></ul><p><strong><em>The Ministry of Health </em></strong>monitors radioactive contamination of food products produced in the public sector and private farms.</p><p><strong><em>The Belarusian Republican Union of Consumer Societies (Belkoopsoyuz) </em></strong>is conducting an assessment of the content of radioactive substances in products that are procured by consumer cooperative organizations.</p><p><strong>The State Committee for Standardization </strong>monitors measurements of radioactive contamination of various objects.</p><p>There are 45 radiation monitoring points in the Republic of Belarus where the gamma radiation dose rate is measured daily. Particular attention is paid to 15 permanent monitoring points located in the Gomel, Mogilev and Brest regions.</p><p>In monitoring points, high levels of gamma radiation dose rate were detected in the cities of Bragin and Slavgorod. The dose rate of gamma radiation for the rest of the territory of Belarus does not exceed the level of natural gamma background and is 0.20 μSv/h (20 μR/h). </p><p>Along with various radiation monitoring points, the Republic of Belarus has 4 automated radiation monitoring systems (ARMS). ARMS monitor the radiation situation in the zones of influence of various nuclear power plants: Chernobyl, Rivne (Ukraine), Ignalina (Lithuania), Smolensk (Russia).</p><p>Along with the radiation monitoring system, Belarus also has a <strong>radiation control system for food products, food and agricultural raw materials, food and other forest products </strong>produced in the territory affected by the Chernobyl disaster.</p><p>Various radiometric and spectrometric equipment is used to analyze radioactive contamination of food and other products. In addition, samples are analyzed annually for cesium-137 and strontium-90. The Ministry of Agriculture and Food has a network of radiation monitoring posts and laboratories.</p><p>At processing plants in radioactive contamination zones, there are 3 stages of control of raw materials and finished products: incoming, during the processing of raw materials, and finished products.</p><p>If high levels of radionuclides are detected in muscle tissue, cattle are returned to farms for special post-treatment. This measure includes feeding rations with low levels of radionuclides. A document is issued for each batch of finished products, which indicates the compliance of the radionuclide content with established standards.</p><p>In the Republic of Belarus, all activities to control the content of radionuclides in food products are considered licensed activities.</p><p><strong>Measures to reduce the levels of radiation doses to people. </strong>To reduce the radiation dose to people living in the radioactive contamination zone, a set of measures is being carried out:</p><p>1. Limiting the intake of radionuclides into the body.</p><p>2. Reducing the absorption of radioactive substances.</p><p>3. Acceleration of the elimination of radionuclides from the body.</p><p><strong>Measures to limit the intake of radionuclides into the body include:</strong></p><ol><li>Culinary and technological processing of food products.</li><li>Limit consumption of “local products”, especially berries and mushrooms.</li></ol><p><strong>1. When carrying out culinary and technological processing of food products, the following rules must be observed:</strong></p><ul><li>Before cooking, mushrooms are cleaned of debris, washed and soaked in a saline solution. Then the mushrooms must be boiled several times with the broth drained. The above treatment helps to reduce the concentration of radionuclides by about 100 times;</li><li>Before consumption, vegetables are cleaned of any soil particles, washed thoroughly, peeled and soaked, draining the brine;</li><li>salting and marinating vegetables, fruits, and mushrooms can reduce the content of radioactive substances by 1.5–2 times (brine and marinade are not consumed);</li><li>Before cooking, the meat is washed in running water, soaked in a salt solution, and after 2-3 hours, this solution is drained. Then a new portion of water is poured in, brought to a boil and drained again. Then a new portion of water is poured in and cooking is carried out;</li><li>The reduction of radionuclide content in fish is facilitated by such measures as cleaning, removing the head and entrails, and rinsing in running water;</li><li>Technological processing of food products helps to significantly reduce the content of radioactive substances. Thus, when milk is processed into cottage cheese, the content of cesium-137 decreases by 4-6 times. Butter contains 50 times less cesium-137 than the milk from which it is produced.</li></ul><p><strong>2. Limit the consumption of "local products", especially berries and mushrooms. </strong>To obtain recommendations on picking mushrooms and berries, you should contact forestry enterprises, forestry departments, as well as district hygiene and epidemiology centers. When harvesting berries and mushrooms, it is necessary to take into account the density of soil contamination with various radionuclides.</p><p>Birch sap must be collected in areas with a pollution density of up to 15 Ci/km2 <sup>. </sup>Birch sap must be collected in areas located in dry places. An increase in the content of cesium-137 is noted in birch sap of trees growing in humid conditions.</p><p><strong>Measures that help reduce the absorption of radioactive substances include:</strong></p><ol><li>The principle of competitive substitution.</li><li>The principle of radionuclide binding in the gastrointestinal tract.</li></ol><p><strong>1. The principle of competitive substitution. </strong>Some radioactive substances and stable elements have common chemical properties. Thus, cesium is similar to potassium, strontium to calcium, plutonium to trivalent iron. Stable elements contained in food compete with radioactive elements and reduce their absorption (Table 13).</p><p>Table 13</p><p><strong>Foods containing stable elements</strong></p><table><tr><td><p><strong>Chemical element</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Daily dose</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Food products</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Potassium</p></td><td><p>3 g</p></td><td><p>Wheat, rye, potatoes, raisins, prunes, dried apricots, tea, nuts, lemon, beans</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Calcium</p></td><td><p>1 g</p></td><td><p>Milk and dairy products, eggs, legumes, green onions, dill, parsley</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Iron</p></td><td><p>15–30 mg</p></td><td><p>Rye bread, meat, fish, green vegetables, sunflower seeds, apples, raisins</p></td></tr></table><p><strong>2. The principle of radionuclide binding in the gastrointestinal tract. </strong>There are a number of substances that form insoluble compounds with radioactive metal ions, i.e. bind radionuclides. Such substances include: pectins, phytates, anthocyanins. These substances are part of carbohydrates and are contained in plant products (Table 14). The formation of insoluble complexes promotes the removal of radionuclides from the body.</p><p>Table 14</p><p><strong>Food products containing substances that bind radionuclides</strong></p><table><tr><td><p><strong>Chemical element</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Food products</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Pectins</p></td><td><p>Eggplants, pears, beets, currants, carrots, apples, cucumbers, peppers, pumpkin, marmalade, marshmallows, juices with pulp</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Phytates</p></td><td><p>Cereals, legumes</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Anthocyanins</p></td><td><p>Plum, black currant, grapes, cherry</p></td></tr></table><p><strong>3. Acceleration of radionuclide removal from the body. </strong>This measure includes various methods of radionuclide removal (Fig. 37).</p><p><strong>Increased intestinal peristalsis </strong>is promoted by eating foods containing fiber. Such foods include: whole grain bread; cereals (buckwheat, oatmeal, millet); vegetables (cabbage, beets, carrots); fruits (prunes).</p><p>Fig.37. Acceleration of the elimination of radionuclides from the body</p><p><strong>Regular passage of bile and urine </strong>is observed when using:</p><ul><li>additional amounts of liquids (tea, juices, fruit drinks, compotes);</li><li>infusions of herbs with diuretic and choleretic effects (chamomile, St. John's wort, immortelle, mint, rose hips, dill).</li></ul><p><strong>Stimulation of lymphatic drainage. </strong>The lymphatic system is responsible for the functioning of detoxification processes in the human body. Medicinal herbs are the main stimulant of the human lymphatic system. Such herbs include: common oats (seeds, oat flakes), blackcurrant leaves, rose hips, plantain, calendula flowers.</p><p><strong>Control questions</strong></p><ol><li>Describe the principles of radiation safety of the population.</li><li>Name the measures to protect the population from man-made radiation.</li><li>What does the term "Radiation Monitoring" mean?</li><li>Which structures of the Republic of Belarus carry out radiation monitoring?</li><li>Describe the radiation monitoring points and automated control systems on the territory of Belarus.</li><li>Name the measures to reduce the levels of radiation doses to people.</li><li>Describe the rules of culinary and technological processing of food products.</li><li>Describe measures that help reduce the absorption of radioactive substances in the human body.</li><li>Describe the measures taken to accelerate the removal of radionuclides from the body.</li></ol>
