Law of the Republic of Belarus "On Labor Protection". <br />Main directions of state policy in the field of labor protection in the Republic of Belarus. Responsibility for violation of labor protection legislation</em></strong></p><p>The basic principles of labor protection are established by <strong>the Law of the Republic of Belarus of 23.06.2008 No. 356-Z “On Labor Protection”.</strong></p><p>Occupational safety and health includes a set of measures aimed at protecting the life and health of workers.</p><p><strong>Responsibility for violation of labor protection legislation includes: </strong>disciplinary (reprimand, reprimand, dismissal), administrative (fine from five to forty basic units for violations), and capital (imprisonment for up to seven years for violation of rules resulting in the death of two or more persons).</p><p><strong><em>15.2. Duties and rights of the employer in the field of labor protection. Duties and rights of the employee in the field of labor protection. <br />Labor protection instructions</em></strong></p><p><strong>The employer's responsibilities for labor protection: </strong>ensuring the safety of the territory, buildings and equipment, monitoring protective equipment, insuring workers, compensating for damage caused to the health of workers, taking measures to prevent accidents, etc.</p><p><strong>Employer rights:</strong> demand compliance with occupational safety standards; reward compliance; conduct alcohol testing; request information about injuries; contact authorities; make proposals for changing standards.</p><p><strong>Employees' responsibilities regarding occupational safety: </strong>undergoing training; fulfilling occupational safety requirements; caring for safety; using protective equipment; reporting accidents.</p><p><strong>Workers' rights</strong>: participation in briefings; receiving information about working conditions; participation in safety discussions; provision of protective equipment; refusal to work if life is at risk.</p><p>Labor protection instructions are local regulations that include labor protection requirements. Instructions are developed on the basis of standard instructions, and employers without the right to approve local documents are guided by standard instructions.</p><p><strong><em>15.3. The concept of harmful and hazardous production factors, <br />their classification and brief characteristics. Classification of working conditions. Principles, methods and means of ensuring the safety of workers</em></strong></p><p><strong>A harmful production factor </strong>is a production factor that leads to illness, decreased performance or death.</p><p><strong>A hazardous production factor </strong>is a production factor that leads to injury or death.</p><p>They are related. For example, high humidity and conductive dust (harmful factors) can increase the risk of electric shock (hazardous factor).</p><p>Harmful and hazardous production factors are classified into physical, chemical, and biological.</p><p><strong><em>Physical factors include </em></strong>dust load, acoustics, microclimate, light environment, electromagnetic fields and radiation, etc.</p><p><strong><em>Chemical factors include </em></strong>substances that cause acute poisoning, carcinogens, allergens, antitumor drugs, hormones, narcotic analgesics, etc.</p><p><strong><em>Biological factors include: </em></strong>pathogenic microorganisms, bacterial preparations, etc.</p><p><strong><em>The factors of the work process are </em></strong>the severity of the work process (lifting and moving heavy objects, working posture, body bending, movements in space due to the technological process, etc.) and the intensity of the work process (intellectual loads, sensory loads, emotional loads, monotony of loads, work schedule).</p><p><strong>Working conditions </strong>are a set of factors in the production environment that affect the health of the worker during the course of work.</p><p><strong>Principles of hygienic classification of working conditions:</strong></p><p>1. Differentiation of levels of deviations of harmful and hazardous production factors from hygienic standards.</p><p>2. Distribution of working conditions according to certain classes.</p><p><strong>Classes of working conditions:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Optimal working conditions (class 1) </strong>– factors that maintain the health of workers.</li><li><strong>Acceptable working conditions (class 2) </strong>are factors that do not exceed legislative standards. Possible changes in the body's condition are restored by the beginning of the next shift and do not have a negative impact on the health of workers and their offspring.</li><li><strong>Harmful working conditions (class 3) </strong>are factors that exceed hygienic standards and have an adverse effect on the health of workers and their offspring.</li><li><strong>Hazardous working conditions (class 4) </strong>are factors that significantly exceed standards and can lead to a high risk of developing severe acute occupational diseases.</li></ol><p><strong>Ensuring industrial safety </strong>includes principles, methods and means that can be divided into four groups:</p><ol><li><strong><em>Guiding principles</em></strong></li></ol><ul><li>The principle of humanization of activity is a focus on human safety.</li><li>The principle of systematicity is taking into account all factors that contribute to accidents and illnesses.</li><li>The principle of destruction is the destruction of a dangerous system by eliminating one of its elements (for example, reducing the temperature to prevent spontaneous combustion).</li><li>The principle of hazard reduction is the use of measures when complete elimination of hazard is impossible (for example, speed limitation).</li><li>The principle of hazard elimination is the elimination of harmful factors (implementation of safe equipment).</li></ul><ol><li><strong><em>Technical principles</em></strong> </li></ol><ul><li>The principle of strength is to increase the safety of materials and structures.</li><li>The principle of protection by distance is to increase the distance from the source of danger (for example, fire breaks).</li><li>The principle of shielding is the use of protective screens against noise, vibration and radiation.</li></ul><ol><li><strong><em>Organizational principles</em></strong> </li></ol><ul><li>The principle of time protection is to reduce the time spent in the area of harmful factors.</li><li>The principle of standardization is the regulation of working conditions (for example, the maximum permissible concentration of harmful substances).</li><li>The principle of ergonomics is the design of equipment and work places taking into account human characteristics.</li></ul><ol><li><strong><em>Management principles</em></strong> </li></ol><ul><li>The principle of planning is the development of areas of activity and quantitative indicators.</li><li>The principle of compensation is the provision of benefits for work in unfavorable conditions.</li><li>The principle of efficiency is a comparison of actual and planned results and an analysis of the achieved indicators.</li></ul><p><strong>Methods of ensuring employee safety </strong>during work activities:</p><ol><li><strong>Distinction between the homosphere and the noxosphere .</strong></li></ol><ul><li><strong>Homosphere</strong>: the work area where a person is located.</li><li><strong>Noxosphere</strong>:<strong> </strong>a space with harmful or dangerous factors.</li><li>Methods: organization, automation, remote control, etc.</li></ul><ol><li><strong>Normalization of the nocosphere </strong><em>(</em>elimination of harmful and dangerous factors using collective means of protection).</li><li><strong>Adaptation of a person to the noxosphere </strong>(training, instruction, use of personal protective equipment).</li></ol><p><strong>Means of ensuring the safety of workers</strong>.</p><p><strong>Collective protection means: </strong>fences, braking devices, alarms, remote control devices, ventilation and heating, safety signs, etc.</p><p><strong>Personal protective equipment</strong>: respiratory protection, insulating suits, special clothing, head, eye, face, hand protection, safety devices, protective dermatological products.</p><p><strong>Control questions</strong></p><ol><li>Give a definition of the term "Labor protection". </li><li>What types of liability are provided for violation of labor protection legislation?</li><li>What rights and responsibilities does an employer have in the area of occupational safety?</li><li>Name the main rights and responsibilities of an employee in the field of labor protection.</li><li>Provide a definition of the term "Occupational safety instructions". What requirements does this document contain?</li><li>Provide a classification and description of harmful and hazardous production factors.</li><li>Formulate a definition of the concept "Working conditions". What classes are they divided into?</li><li>Name the principles of hygienic classification of working conditions.</li><li>Describe the principles of ensuring worker safety.</li><li>List three methods to ensure employee safety during work activities.</li><li>Describe the security measures<strong> </strong>working.</li></ol>
