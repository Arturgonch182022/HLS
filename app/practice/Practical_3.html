Organizational and technical measures, automatic fire extinguishing systems. </strong>The safety of passenger transportation in public transport depends not only on the duties of the driver, passenger, requirements for the technical condition of vehicles, but also on fire safety systems. Currently, the most important element of fire safety is the automatic fire extinguishing system. <strong><em>Automatic fire extinguishing system</em></strong> includes the following elements <strong>:</strong> automatic fire extinguishing system, automatic fire alarm, <a href="http://tsc.by/product_list/group_243097" target="_self">warning and evacuation control system </a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong><em>Automatic fire extinguishing system (AFES) </em></strong>is a fire extinguishing system that is automatically activated when <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9F%D0%BE%D0%B6%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%B1%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8C#.D0.9E.D0.BF.D0.B0.D1.81.D0.BD.D1.8B.D0.B5_.D1.84.D0.B0.D0.BA.D1.82.D0.BE.D1.80.D1.8B_.D0.BF.D0.BE.D0.B6.D0.B0.D1.80.D0.B0">fire factors exceed </a>threshold values in the protected area. A distinctive feature of automatic systems is that they also perform automatic fire alarm functions. There are several types of AFES. Aerosol and foam automatic fire extinguishing systems are recommended for localizing and extinguishing fires in transport.</p><p><strong>Liability for violation of fire safety rules in transport. </strong>Violation of fire safety rules in railway, automobile, water or air transport, urban electric transport (in the subway, tram, trolleybus), highways and road structures - entails the imposition of a fine of up to twenty basic units.</p><p><strong>2. Procedure for passengers of public urban transport (tram, trolleybus, bus) in case of an accident. Recommendations for actions of citizens in case of fire, in public urban automobile and electric transport</strong></p><p>Accidents on public transport (bus, trolleybus, tram, metro) occur much less frequently than on automobile transport, but even here emergency situations may arise involving human casualties and material damage.</p><p><strong>The procedure for passengers in case of accidents on public transport (collision, rollover) (fig. 10):</strong></p><ol><li>It is necessary to take a stable position and firmly grasp the handrails (belts) with your hands; the seated passenger should rest his feet on the floor, his hands on the front seat (panel) and tilt his head forward.</li><li>The accident happens quickly, after the accident a rollover and overturning are possible. You must not relax and keep all your muscles tense until it becomes absolutely clear that there will be no more movement.</li><li>After the impact has occurred, the first thing you need to do is determine where and in what place in the vehicle, and in what position you are, whether there is a fire, whether gasoline is leaking (especially in the event of a rollover). Depending on the situation, move to the exit - through the door or window. If there are a lot of people in the vehicle, it is wiser to use emergency exits in addition to the doors and windows. You can get out by breaking the window glass. However, glass can be strong and you should find suitable improvised means to break it. Having broken the glass, do not forget about the fragments - in a panic you can seriously injure yourself.</li><li>Once outside, immediately get involved in rescue operations: if necessary, help passengers break glass, pull out victims, provide first aid, etc.</li></ol><p><img

/></p><p>Fig. 10. Measures to take in case of an accident on public transport</p><p><strong>Recommendations for citizens’ actions in the event of a fire in public transport:</strong></p><ol><li>Immediately report the appearance of smoke or fire to the driver. Try to open the doors (use the emergency opening button).</li></ol><p>If the doors are blocked, use the emergency hatches in the roof and the side windows for evacuation. If necessary, knock out the windows with both feet (or a hard object). If you have successfully freed yourself without serious injuries, then, as far as possible, help those remaining, especially children and the elderly.</p><ol><li>Any vehicle contains materials that emit toxic gases when burning, so leave the vehicle quickly, covering your mouth and nose with a handkerchief or sleeve.</li><li>Try using a fire extinguisher and improvised means to put out the fire. BE CAREFUL! In trolleybuses and trams, metal parts may become energized as a result of the protective insulation of the wires burning.</li><li>Leave the vehicle, letting children, women and the elderly go first. Once you get out of the vehicle, move away as far as possible, as fuel tanks may explode or a short circuit may occur in the high-voltage electrical network.</li><li>Report the fire by phone or through drivers of passing cars.<strong> </strong>Call the Ministry of Emergency Situations on duty at 101. Provide assistance to the victims.</li></ol><p><strong>The order of actions for passengers in case of a fire in the metro:</strong></p><p>1. If you smell smoke, immediately inform the driver about the fire via the intercom.</p><p>2. If an open fire appears in the carriage while the train is moving, try to put it out using the fire extinguishers under the seats or improvised means. If possible, move to the part of the carriage not occupied by the fire (preferably forward) and contain the spread of the fire by knocking down the flames with clothing or pouring any non-flammable liquids (water, milk, etc.) on them. Never try to stop the train in a tunnel with the emergency stopcock - this will make it more difficult to put out the fire and evacuate you.</p><p>3. In case of heavy smoke, close your eyes and breathe through a damp handkerchief, respirator or gas mask.</p><p>4. In case of a major fire in the carriage itself, break the window at the end of the carriage and move to the next one, provide assistance to children and the elderly.</p><p>5. After arriving at the station and opening the doors, let children and the elderly go first. Check if anyone is left in the carriage, help these people to leave it. Immediately report the fire to the station duty officer and the escalator.</p><p>When a train stops in a tunnel, do not attempt to leave it without the driver's command; do not touch the metal body of the car or the doors until the high voltage has been switched off throughout the entire section.</p><p>After permission to exit, open the doors or kick out the windows, exit the carriage and move forward in the direction of the train to the station. Walk along the track between the rails in single file, without touching the current-carrying buses (on the side of the rails) to avoid electric shock when the voltage is turned on. Be especially careful when exiting the tunnel near the station, at the intersections of tracks, at switches, as an oncoming train may appear.</p><p>If the train you left behind has moved and is catching up with you, press yourself against the niche of the tunnel wall. Immediately inform the station attendant about what happened and follow his instructions.</p><p><strong>3. Procedure for passengers in case of fire in a railway carriage. Emergency safety measures in case of dangerous incidents on water and air transport</strong></p><p><strong>In case of fire on the train:</strong></p><p>1. Immediately inform the conductor about the fire, walk through the carriage and announce the incident to the passengers. Wake up sleeping passengers. The safest way is to evacuate to the front carriages, but if this is not possible, then go to the end of the train, tightly closing the doors of the compartments and inter-carriage passages behind you.</p><p>2. Using fire extinguishers and improvised means (blankets, wet rags, etc.), try to put out the fire together with the passengers. Close the windows so that the wind does not fan the flames. Do not try to save your luggage from the fire if this threatens your safety (take only the most necessary things - documents, money, valuables, etc.).</p><p>If the fire has cut you off from the exits, then enter the compartment or toilet, close the door tightly behind you, open the window and wait for help to arrive, attracting attention to yourself. Do not jump out of the carriage of a moving train and do not try to get out onto the roof. Jump out of the carriage only as a last resort, putting on more clothes for cushioning and using a mattress.</p><p>3. If it is impossible to extinguish the fire and contact the train conductor or the driver, stop the train using the emergency brake, remove all people from the car by opening the doors or breaking the windows. Take passengers away from the burning car and send people to the nearest populated area to report the incident to the fire department.</p><p><strong>Emergency safety measures in case of dangerous incidents on water transport. What to do if the vessel is sinking:</strong></p><p>1. Follow all instructions from the captain clearly and quickly.</p><p>2. Put on life jackets for yourself and your loved ones, remove any tight clothing and shoes. Take your documents with you (under your underwear), having previously wrapped them in a plastic bag.</p><p>3. Quickly, but without undue haste, go up on deck and, at the captain’s command, board the boats (rafts) one by one, letting children and women go first;</p><p>4. If it is impossible to get into the boat, take any floating object with you (a ring, a board, an empty plastic bottle with a closed cap, etc.) and, after looking around, jump into the water feet first.</p><p>5. Once in the water, swim 200-300 m away from the side of the ship to avoid being pulled under the water or under the bottom of the ship.</p><p>If possible, help people nearby stay afloat. Try to form a group to help each other and organize joint rescue efforts.</p><p>When you see a boat with free space, swim up to it from the stern, do not lean on the side. If there is no space in the boat, ask to throw you a rope (cable, rope), tie it around your waist and swim to the shore behind the boat.</p><p>Save your strength and monitor the blood circulation in your hands and feet (to restore blood circulation, do a massage). If you are very thirsty, put a wet handkerchief on your head and wipe your body with it.</p><p><strong>Emergency safety measures in case of dangerous incidents in air transport. Actions in case of a fire that occurs during landing of an aircraft:</strong></p><p>1. Observe all instructions prescribed by the flight rules.</p><p>2. Protect exposed ­areas of the body from direct exposure to fire by using available clothing, blankets, etc. Breathe only through cotton or woolen clothing, if possible moistened with water.</p><p>3. After the plane lands and stops, immediately head to the nearest exit. In a smoke-filled airplane cabin, it is better to crawl or crawl to the exit, as there is less smoke below.</p><p>4. If the passage is blocked, make your way through the chairs, lowering their backs.</p><p>5. After ­exiting the plane, move as far away from it as possible and lie down on the ground, pressing your head with your hands - there is a possibility of an explosion.</p><p><strong>Factors that contribute to the emergence of panic, ways and means of its termination. Prevention of panic among passengers on public transport</strong>. <strong>Panic </strong>is a state of mass fear in the presence of an obvious or imaginary threat.</p><p><strong>The following factors contribute to the emergence of panic:</strong></p><p>1.<strong> </strong>Limiting the space in which events develop (or developed), especially if the exit is difficult.</p><p>2. Real concerns, difficult to accurately assess, of a large number of people for their own health and lives.</p><p>3.<strong> </strong>The presence of a certain “emotional orientation” of the masses that is conducive to panic, which is expressed in general excitement, anxiety, and which can be intensified not only by a real threat, but also by rumors.<strong> </strong></p><p>4.<strong> </strong>Lack of confidence in the competence of the forces called upon to maintain public order during disasters, which greatly complicates rescue operations.</p><p><strong>To prevent panic, </strong>it is necessary to tell people the whole truth about what happened from the very beginning of the emergency. Information should be repeated periodically, increased. It is necessary not only to talk about the course of rescue operations and give explanations, but also to make requests to them, <a href="http://www.pandia.ru/text/category/vovlechenie/">to involve </a>them in the common cause of eliminating the consequences of a natural disaster or accident. Each person should feel involved in these important events.</p><p><strong>What to do if panic does arise? </strong>It should be stopped immediately and decisively. And preferably as early as possible, when it is superficial, has not affected large masses and can be quickly eliminated.</p><p>To do this, first of all, it is necessary to distract people's attention from the source of fear or panic-causing agent, at least for a short time. Give people the opportunity to wake up from fear, at least for a moment, and try to take control of the crowd. Try to switch people's attention from the actions of the panic-mongering "leader" to a person who thinks soberly and has a cool head. Here, there should be a place for powerful and loud commands from people with a strong character.</p><p>Usually, when the initial feeling of fear passes, most people in such a situation experience increased activity, a desire to somehow make amends for their guilt. This should be used to involve everyone in rescue work, assigning each a specific area.</p><p>If panic has nevertheless taken hold of a significant number of people, they must be divided into smaller groups, each of which will be much easier to deal with.</p><p><strong>Test questions and tasks</strong></p><ol><li>List the legal acts that determine the safe transportation of passengers by transport.</li><li>What are the responsibilities of a passenger when using urban electric transport?</li><li>Complete the diagram.</li><li>Describe the rules of conduct for passengers in the event of an accident on public transport.</li><li>Provide recommendations on actions to be taken by citizens in the event of a fire in public transport.</li><li>Make a plan of actions for a passenger in the event of a fire on a train.</li><li>Describe emergency safety measures in case of accidents on water transport.</li><li>Create an algorithm of actions for a passenger in the event of a fire on an airplane.</li><li>Name the measures that help stop panic during transport accidents.</li><li>Describe the rules of conduct for passengers in the event of a fire in the subway.</li></ol>
