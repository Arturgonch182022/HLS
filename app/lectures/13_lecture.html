Fossil fuels, their characteristics and reserves in the Republic of Belarus</em></strong></p><p>According to their physical state, there are three types of fuel: solid, liquid, and gaseous.</p><p><strong>Solid fuel.  </strong>Solid fuels include plant components such as wood, reeds, straw, and corn. As a result of humification of organic matter, solid fossil fuels are formed (excluding shale).</p><p>Wood, peat, brown coal, oil shale are the fuel resources that are widely distributed in the Republic of Belarus.</p><p><strong>Nuclear fuel. </strong>Heavy nuclei of thorium and uranium are the only natural type of nuclear fuel. When the isotope <sup>235</sup>U, which is present in natural uranium in an amount of 0.7%, is fissioned, energy is released in the form of heat. <sup>239</sup>Th and <sup>238</sup>U can be used as raw materials. These isotopes, under the influence of neutron irradiation, become new nuclear fuel: <sup>239</sup>U and <sup>239</sup>Pu. In 1 kilogram of uranium we get as much energy as the combustion of 2700 tons of high-quality coal.</p><p>Nuclear fuel is actively used in reactors, where it is stored in the form of small pellets in sealed fuel elements.</p><p><strong>Liquid fuel. </strong>A significant portion of liquid fuel is obtained by refining oil. Its distillation produces such products as kerosene, gasoline, various lubricating oils, and also Vaseline, which is used in medicine.</p><p>After extraction, oil must be heated to approximately 350Â°C, then the resulting steam must be distilled into fractions: diesel (18%), kerosene (17%), gasoline (15%), liquefied gas (1%). The remainder after processing is fuel oil.</p><p>The country's key oil reserves are located in the Pripyat Trough area. There are 55 known oil sources, including 53 in the Gomel Region and 2 in the Mogilev Region. One of the significant deposits being developed is the Rechitsa field, which has been in operation since 1965.</p><p><strong>Gaseous fuel. </strong>The most common representative of gaseous fuel is natural gas. Its basis is CH4 (methane). There is also associated gas obtained during oil production. Its feature is a lower content of methane and a higher content of higher hydrocarbons than in natural gas.</p><p>Gas underground is located under pressure in unique waterproof domes made of clay and sandstone. It consists mainly of CH4. Condensate droplets, sand suspension and other inclusions are removed from the gas when it leaves the well. Then it is fed to the main gas pipeline, which has a diameter of about 1 meter and a length of several thousand kilometers. The average pressure in the gas pipeline is 5 MPa. This pressure is maintained by compressors installed every 100 meters. The compressors operate from the gas in the gas pipeline and consume about 11% of all gas. Therefore, gas transportation is quite expensive.</p><p>In Belarus, proven gas reserves amount to approximately three billion m<sup>3</sup>, of which 0.3 billion m<sup>3</sup> is natural gas.</p><p>One of the most promising types of fuel is hydrogen. Compared to oil, it has 3 times more energy capacity. Almost all hydrogen is now obtained from natural gas, but in the foreseeable future it can be obtained as a result of coal gasification. Hydrogen can be obtained through the electrolysis of water.</p><p><strong><em>13.2. Energy, its types. Traditional sources of electrical energy: thermal, water flow energy, nuclear energy</em></strong></p><p>Energy is a single numerical measure of the motion and interaction of all types of matter. Energy is the ability to perform work, and work is performed when a physical force acts on a body.</p><p>There are several types of energy. These include: mechanical, electrical, thermal, magnetic, and atomic energy.</p><p>Electricity is one of the most common. It is widely used because it can be obtained from various renewable sources, is environmentally friendly, is easily converted into various types of energy, and is easy to transport.</p><p>Thermal energy is widely used both in industry and in everyday life. It is used in the form of steam - the result of combustion of fuel or hot water.</p><p>In our country, a significant portion of energy (more than 90%) is produced at thermal power plants.</p><p><strong>Thermal power plants </strong>(TPPs) produce electricity using heat energy from the combustion of organic fuels such as coal and gas. They have become the main source of energy since the 1970s and include combined heat and power plants (CHPs), which also provide heat. CHPs are less reliable due to high losses during heat transfer. In Belarus, the capacity of power plants is 9,741 MW, of which 97% are TPPs. Lukomlskaya GRES with a capacity of 2.9 GW is the largest in the country, and in the world - Tuoketuo in China with a capacity of 6,600 MW.</p><p><strong>A hydroelectric power station </strong>(HPP) is a complex of structures that converts the energy of a water flow into electrical energy. A HPP includes hydraulic structures and equipment where the water flow rotates a hydraulic turbine connected to a generator. There are several types of HPPs: run-of-river, dam and diversion, depending on the method of using water and the pressure level. </p><p>The operating principle is elementary and is practically identical everywhere. The water pressure, which is directed at the blades of the hydro turbine, causes it to rotate, and the hydro turbine, in turn, being connected to the generator, rotates the generator. The generator produces electricity, which is fed to the transformer station, and then to the power transmission line.</p><p>The capacity of a HPP depends on the volume and pressure of the water. The largest HPP is the Three Gorges HPP on the Yangtze River in China (22,500 MW). As of January 1, 2020, there are 25 HPPs in operation in Belarus with a total capacity of 88.26 MW.</p><p><strong>Pumped storage power plants </strong>(PSPP) are used to smooth out fluctuations in electrical load during the day. They work with pumps and generators, pumping water into the upper pool at night, when energy is cheaper, and releasing it during the day to generate expensive electricity. PSPPs are effective in large energy systems where the main sources are nuclear and thermal power plants that are not able to quickly regulate energy production. The largest PSPP is Bass County in the USA (3003 MW). Belarus is discussing the possibility of creating its own PSPP.</p><p><strong>Nuclear power plants </strong>(NPPs) produce electrical energy by converting nuclear energy. The main element is a nuclear reactor, where the fission of heavy elements releases heat, which is used to generate electricity. NPPs operate on nuclear fuel such as uranium and plutonium, the reserves of which significantly exceed those of organic fuel, which gives them an advantage. The increase in the cost of organic fuel creates economic problems for developing countries, which emphasizes the need to develop nuclear energy. In Belarus, a NPP is being built 18 km from Ostrovets with a design capacity of 2400 MW. The most powerful NPP in the world is Kashiwazaki-Kariwa in Japan (7965 MW).</p><p><strong><em>13.3. Environmental problems of using traditional energy sources</em></strong></p><p><strong>Environmental issues in thermal energy. </strong>Combustion of coal, wood and other natural resources produces about 89% of energy, while the share of thermal sources in the electricity industry is 81%. In developed countries, oil is more often used for transport, and coal remains the main source of electricity in countries such as China (76%).</p><p>Combustion of fuel results in emissions of harmful substances, making thermal power plants a leading source of greenhouse gases and acid rain. Thermal power plants emit about 51% of carbon, 36% of nitrogen oxides and 34% of dust into the atmosphere. It is estimated that nuclear power plants have 2-4 times less impact on the environment with radioactive substances than thermal power plants of the same capacity.</p><p>Emissions from thermal power plants contain significant amounts of metals: more than 110 million doses of aluminum, 400 million doses of iron and about 1.5 million doses of magnesium. Thus, thermal power plants have a negative impact on the environment, including soil, water and forests.</p><p><strong>Environmental problems of hydropower</strong>. The creation of reservoirs during the construction of hydroelectric power plants floods millions of hectares of fertile land and destroys ecosystems (for example, in Russia about 6 million hectares are flooded). This also leads to flooding of lands, which become swampy, and coastal erosion, which destroys natural communities.</p><p>These processes can last for decades and lead to soil processing, silting of reservoirs and water pollution. Ecosystems end up under water, which increases the amount of organic matter and creates conditions for the overgrowth of water bodies with algae and bacteria. This worsens the quality of water, reduces oxygen and leads to the death of aquatic inhabitants, including helminth infection.</p><p>Fish migration changes, spawning grounds and feeding grounds are destroyed. Therefore, when constructing reservoirs, it is important to minimize changes in the hydrological regime of rivers and ecosystems to reduce the negative impact on the species composition of aquatic organisms.</p><p><strong>Environmental problems of nuclear energy.</strong></p><p>Nuclear power plants (NPPs) have advantages such as an abundance of nuclear fuel and minimal environmental impact during standard operation. Nuclear fuel is economical to transport because it is required in small quantities.</p><p>Since the end of the 20th century, the share of nuclear power plants in the world's energy supply has increased to 16%. However, there are serious drawbacks, including difficulties in disposing of spent nuclear fuel and the high costs of dismantling old plants.</p><p>Key issues with nuclear power plants include ecosystem destruction due to fuel extraction, land acquisition, deterioration of water quality due to water abstraction, and risks of radioactive contamination. This highlights the need for careful handling of nuclear energy and strategies to reduce its negative impacts.</p><p><strong>Control questions</strong></p><ol><li>Please describe the fossil fuels most commonly used in the Republic of Belarus as an energy source?</li><li>Name the environmental problems that arise as a result of using traditional sources of electricity.</li><li>What chemical elements are used as raw materials for nuclear fuel?</li><li>Where are the main oil reserves located in the Republic of Belarus?</li><li>Does the Republic of Belarus have natural gas reserves?
