Current state of the environment in the Republic of Belarus. Unresolved environmental problems at the present stage. National Environmental Monitoing System (NEMS)</em></strong></p><p><strong>Current state of the environment in the Republic of Belarus. Unresolved environmental problems at the present stage. </strong>Anthropogenic factors have a great influence on the environmental situation in Belarus. The sources of anthropogenic factors impact on the environment are: housing and communal services, agricultural activities, transport, industrial and energy enterprises.</p><p><strong>The main environmental problems of Belarus include:</strong></p><p><strong><em>1. Problems associated with the depletion of natural resources </em></strong>are caused by large-scale drainage reclamation (over 3.5 million hectares ) carried out in the 1960–1980s in the Republic of Belarus.</p><p><strong><em>2. Problems caused by environmental pollution include: </em></strong>radioactive contamination of the territory, air pollution, surface and ground water pollution, accumulation of industrial and municipal waste. Therefore, it is necessary to actively collect and recycle garbage .</p><p><em>The most important environmental problem is radioactive contamination of the territory.</em> </p><p><strong>Persistent organic pollutants</strong>.</p><p>The list of persistent organic pollutants includes 24 names. The specified list is expanding as information on the properties of hazardous chemicals accumulates. Among POPs, chlorine-containing pesticides constitute a whole group.</p><p>As a result of monitoring observations of the condition of storage sites for obsolete pesticides, the following problems were identified:</p><ul><li>unsatisfactory condition of storage facilities (roof damage, discrepancy between the size of storage facilities and the amount of chemicals stored there, etc.);</li><li>violation of pesticide accounting rules;</li><li>formation of new chemicals with unknown properties (mixing of pesticides during the process of their repackaging in plastic containers);</li><li>storage of repackaged pesticides, resulting in deformation of the barrels and the risk of emergency situations.</li></ul><p>Measures to eliminate obsolete pesticides classified as persistent organic pollutants in Belarus are planned to be completed by 2025.</p><p><strong>The National Environmental Monitoring System (NEMS) </strong>is an information system on the state of the environment that combines the means of collecting information and all stages of its processing before transmitting the information to consumers.</p><p><strong><em>The main goal of creating the NSMOS </em></strong>is to consolidate disparate environmental information and provide all levels of government with objective data for making operational decisions and determining environmental management strategies.</p><p>The organization and implementation of monitoring is carried out by republican government bodies (Table 16).</p><p>Table 16</p><p><strong>Structure and functions of the National Environmental Monitoring System</strong></p><table><tr><td><p><strong>Republican bodies <br />of state administration</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Type of monitoring</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection</p></td><td><p>Atmospheric air monitoring, surface water monitoring, groundwater monitoring, local monitoring (monitoring of small areas), radiation monitoring</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>National Academy of Sciences of Belarus</p></td><td><p>Monitoring of fauna, monitoring of flora, geophysical monitoring</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Ministry of Education</p></td><td><p>Ozone layer monitoring</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Ministry of Forestry</p></td><td><p>Forest monitoring</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>State <br />Property Committee</p></td><td><p>Land monitoring</p></td></tr></table><p><strong><em>12.3. Specially protected natural areas of the Republic of Belarus. International activities of the Republic of Belarus in the field of environmental protection</em></strong></p><p><strong>Specially protected natural areas (SPNA) are </strong>parts of the territory of the Republic of Belarus with unique natural complexes and objects of special ecological and aesthetic significance and for which a special regime of protection and use has been established.</p><p>Protected natural areas are defined by the Law of the Republic of Belarus “On Specially Protected Natural Areas”.</p><p>There are 4 categories of protected areas depending on the functions and modes of protection and use (Fig. 39).</p><p>A <strong><em>reserve </em></strong>is a specially protected natural area declared for the purpose of preserving valuable natural complexes and objects, studying living organisms and natural ecological systems (terrestrial, aquatic), and creating conditions for ensuring the natural course of natural processes.</p><p><strong><em>A national park </em></strong>is a specially protected natural area declared for the purpose of restoring and preserving valuable natural complexes and objects, and their use in the process of various environmental activities (nature conservation, scientific, educational, tourist, recreational and health-improving).</p><p>Fig. 39. Protected natural areas depending on the functions and modes of protection and use</p><p><strong><em>A nature reserve </em></strong>is a specially protected natural area declared for the purpose of restoration, conservation and reproduction of natural complexes and objects, natural resources of one or several types with restrictions on the use of other natural resources.</p><p><strong><em>A natural monument </em></strong>is a specially protected natural area declared for the purpose of preserving valuable natural objects in the interests of present and future generations.</p><p><em>Unlike reserves and national parks, any economic activity is completely prohibited on the territory of reserves: mining, hunting, fishing, etc. In these territories, tourism activity is limited.</em></p><p>Natural monuments include centuries-old trees, parks, hills, ditches, etc.</p><p>80% of rare and endangered wild plant species are registered within the boundaries of specially protected natural areas. In addition, about 90% of rare and endangered wild animal species live in these areas. The area of specially protected natural areas is 8.2% of the total area of the country.</p><p><strong>International activities in the field of environmental protection </strong>are defined by agreements, protocols and conventions.</p><p><strong>Control questions:</strong></p><ol><li>Name the main types of liability for violation of environmental legislation.</li><li>What are the unresolved environmental problems in Belarus?</li><li>What measures are being taken in the Republic of Belarus to reduce the growth of emissions of various pollutants?</li><li>What natural and anthropogenic factors influence the quality of underground drinking water?</li><li>Name the problems identified as a result of monitoring the condition of storage sites for obsolete pesticides.</li><li>Formulate a definition of the concept "National Environmental Monitoring System". State the purpose of its creation and its main functions.</li><li>Which republican government bodies organize and conduct environmental monitoring?</li><li>What categories of specially protected natural areas, depending on their functions and protection regime, exist in the Republic of Belarus?</li></ol><p>What is the share of specially protected natural areas in the total area of the country?</p>
