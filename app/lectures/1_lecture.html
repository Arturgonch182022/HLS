Belarus</em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Civil defence </strong>is an integral part of the defence measures of the Republic of Belarus to protect the population and material values from dangers arising in the course of military operations.</p><p><strong><em>Civil defence is organised </em></strong>according to administrative-territorial and sectoral principles.</p><p><strong><em>The conduct of civil defence </em></strong>is determined by <strong><em>civil defence </em></strong>plans, which are put into effect in the territory of the Republic of Belarus from the moment war is declared, hostilities actually begin or martial law is declared by the President of the Republic of Belarus.</p><p><strong><em>The main tasks of civil defence (CD):</em></strong></p><ul><li> training of the population in methods of defence against wartime hazards;</li><li> ensuring sustainable functioning of economic facilities and life support systems (water, food, medical support) of the population in wartime;</li><li> alerting the population to the dangers associated with military operations;</li><li> temporary resettlement of the population, provision of personal and collective protection equipment;</li><li> evacuation of material assets to safe areas in case of threat of their theft or destruction;</li><li> carrying out emergency rescue and other urgent works (AS and

hazards.</li></ul><p><strong>Elements of the organisational structure of civil defence:</strong></p><ul><li> Management of civil defence in the Republic of Belarus;</li><li> Civil defence management bodies;</li><li> Civil defence forces</li></ul><p><strong><em>Civil defence management </em></strong>is carried out not only in wartime, but also in peacetime. <em>In wartime, civil defence management is carried out by the CS headquarters.</em></p><p><strong>Civil defence forces include: civil defence </strong>services, civilian civil defence formations, civil defence observation and laboratory control network.</p><p><strong><em>Civil Defence Services. </em></strong>Depending on the administrative-territorial principle of civil defence organisation and the functions performed, the following

service </em></strong>- ensuring sustainable functioning of energy networks, elimination of accidents on the above mentioned networks, organisation of purchase of reserve sources of energy supply in the organisations of the Ministry of Energy.</li></ul><p><strong>Civilian civil defence formations </strong>are designed to carry out rescue and other emergency work in emergencies, both peacetime and wartime. CDFGs are established in organisations that have hazardous facilities or facilities of important economic and defence significance.</p><p><strong><em>Object civilian formations </em></strong>are created by the heads of civil defence of organisations. The main purpose of the above-mentioned formations is to carry out emergency rescue and other urgent work in the respective organisations during emergencies.</p><p><strong><em>Civilian general purpose formations </em></strong>are intended to carry out AS and DNR of a general nature. These activities include:</p><ul><li> clearing and opening rubble, damaged shelters and refuges;</li><li> Searching for and extracting people from collapsed structures;</li><li> providing first aid to victims and organising the transportation of victims to medical institutions.</li></ul><p>The constituent elements of general purpose civilian formations are: combined squads, teams and groups.</p><p><strong><em>Civilian special-purpose formations shall carry out:</em></strong></p><ul><li> liaising and conducting reconnaissance;</li><li> providing medical care;</li><li> localising and extinguishing fires;</li><li> community policing;</li><li> carrying out and logistical support of measures to ensure the safety of the population (anti-radiation, anti-chemical, sanitary-hygienic and anti-epidemic).</li></ul><p>Special-purpose civilian formations are also intended to support the activities of general-purpose civilian formations.</p><p><strong><em>Depending on the nature of the tasks performed in various emergencies, the following civilian civil defence formations are distinguished:</em></strong></p><ul><li> forming a bond;</li><li> firefighting;</li><li> medical;</li><li> of the intelligence formation;</li><li> radiation, chemical and biological defence;</li><li> automotive;</li><li> emergency and engineering;</li><li> formations of mechanisation of work;</li><li> trade and catering;</li><li> community policing.</li></ul><p>In wartime, the total number of the civilian formation of the Civil Defence Forces must be at least 20% of the organisation's full-time employees.</p><p> </p><p><strong><em>1.4 Notification of citizens about emergency situations.</em></strong> <strong><em>Procedure of actions of employees of organisations and population in emergencies</em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Emergency notification </strong>is the delivery of notification signals and information about the threat of natural and man-made emergencies, rules of behaviour, and the course of liquidation of the consequences of the emergency to the population and the emergency management bodies of the State Emergency Service.</p><p>In the Republic of Belarus, <strong>an automated centralised warning system (ACWS) </strong>is used to notify the population of emergency situations.</p><p><strong>Notification system </strong>is an organisational and technical integration of forces, means of notification and information, means of telecommunication and mass information, which provide notification and information to the population and the emergency management bodies of the State Emergency Situations Service.</p><p><strong><em>Levels of operation of the warning system:</em></strong></p><ul><li> republican (territory of the Republic of Belarus);</li><li> territorial (territory of the region and the city of Minsk);</li><li> local (territory of the district and city);</li><li> object (territory of the object or areas of possible threat from this object).</li></ul><p><em>Technical means of the ASCS:</em></p><p>1. electric horns and signalling loudspeaker installations.</p><p>2. Street loudspeakers.</p><p>3. telephone and cellular communication (sending SMS messages).</p><p>4. television.</p><p>5. Wireless radio broadcasting (interception of FM channels).</p><p>6. Internet Network.</p><p>There are 4,500 electric horns and 1,500 street loudspeakers in use in the Republic of Belarus.</p><p>The main method of notification of the population about emergencies in the Republic of Belarus is the transmission of speech information. Transmission of this type of information to the population may be carried out with interruption of TV and radio broadcasting programmes for no more than 5 minutes. In addition, two or three times repetition of speech information transmission is allowed.</p><p>In the territories not covered by ASCCs (gardening communities, sparsely populated areas), vehicles with loudspeaker signalling systems can be used to alert the population. There are more than 5.3 thousand vehicles equipped with these devices in Belarus.</p><p><strong>In peacetime</strong>, one civil defence signal with the conventional name <strong><em>"Attention All!" </em></strong>is used<strong><em>.</em></strong></p><p>This signal is transmitted to the population by switching on sirens or other signalling devices for 3 minutes. Upon hearing the signal <strong><em>"Attention All!"</em></strong>, every citizen should switch on a radio, radio receiver, TV set to a local station. The above-mentioned means of notification will transmit information about the emergency situation and instructions for protection.</p><p><strong>In wartime, in </strong>addition to the <strong><em>"Attention All!" </em></strong>signal, other civil defence signals are also used: <strong><em>"Air Alert!", "Cancel Air Alert!", "Chemical Alert!", "Radiation Danger!". </em></strong>When an air, chemical or radiation danger occurs, the signal "Attention All!" is transmitted first, followed by information. For example, "Attention! Attention! Citizens! Radiation danger!" etc. After the transmission of GO signals, recommendations for protection will be given.</p><p><strong>Procedure for actions of employees of organisations and population in natural and man-made emergencies:</strong></p><p>1. Understand from the transmitted information the location of the emergency, the direction of spread of the striking factor (in case of flooding - the path of water spread; in case of an accident at a chemical plant - the direction of movement of the poisonous cloud), ways and means of evacuation.</p><p>2. In case of an accident at a chemically hazardous facility - prepare personal respiratory and skin protection equipment.</p><p>3. set up a shelter in your home or prepare essentials for evacuation (first aid kit, food and drinking water, personal documents, warm clothes).</p><p><strong>Rules of behaviour in the event of war-related hazards:</strong></p><p><strong><em>1. If an alert signal is received at home:</em></strong></p><ul><li> cut off the gas and electricity;</li><li> prepare documents, money, food and medical supplies for evacuation;</li><li> to leave the building and go down to the nearest shelter.</li></ul><p><strong><em>2. If the notification signal is caught on the street or in public transport:</em></strong></p><ul><li>we need to find the nearest shelter;</li><li>If the latter is not available, basements, underground passages, metro stations can be used. You can also take shelter in all sorts of ditches, ravines, etc.</li></ul><ol><li><strong><em>If the alert signal is caught in a shop, market or theatre:</em></strong></li></ol><ul><li>you must listen carefully to the administration's instructions about where the nearest shelter is;</li><li>If there are no instructions from the administration, you should: go outside, look around and locate the nearest shelter.</li></ul><p><strong><em>Procedures for dealing with acts of terrorism</em></strong><em>:</em></p><ul><li>    do not touch ownerless packages (bags, boxes, etc.) found in the entrance of the house, on the street or in public transport;</li><li>    If there is an explosion, prevent the fire from spreading, take measures to prevent panic and provide first aid to the injured;</li><li>    To minimise blood loss in case of injury, move as little as possible;</li><li>    In the presence of terrorists, it is necessary to remain calm, refrain from sudden movements and shouting;</li><li>    If there is a threat of terrorists using weapons, lie on your stomach, cover your head with your hands, and stay away from windows and glass doors;</li><li>    every opportunity for rescue must be seized.</li></ul><p><strong>Control questions</strong></p><p>1.
